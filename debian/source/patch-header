This patch contains all the Debian-specific changes mixed together. To review
them separately, please inspect the VCS history at
http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-ruby-extras/ruby-term-ansicolor.git;a=summary

In special, the branch called "for-upstream" contains commits that are supposed
to be sent to the original developers. Commits that are not in that branch are
probably Debian-specific and you do not need to care about those.
